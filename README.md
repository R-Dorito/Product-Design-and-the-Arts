<h1>Art and Design</h1>
  <h2>Gravity Car</h2>
  <h3>Concepts</h3>
    <p>The goal of this design was to create a small car that would carry a 10kg weight. In this design, we decided why carry the weight when we can use the weight to move the art forward?</p>
    <p>Here is the initial sketches of the design</p>

   <p>In these early design, I had wanted to use the weight of the load to move the car forward. This was done by using the weight as a pendulum, then as a wheel that would rotate in a circle, driving the car's wheels forward</p> 
   <p>After picking out a few designs and discussing their problems, we decided to select 3 and render them to visually see how the concept designs will look.</p>

 <h3>Design Updates</h3>
   
   <p>After the designs were rendered, we realised that we liked ideas from all 3 designs and decided that we should combine the features into one product. Below is another iteration of the design.</p>

   <p>Once the above designs were created, we had to consider the 10 KG loads and how that would affect the overall structure of the body. 
    As we were using a sheet metal body, we thought the thin triangluar shape would not be sufficent enough to support the weight of the load, and so we increased the triangular sizing of the body.</p>

<h3>Final Designs</h3>
<p>The final designs were made after a few changes, and this is what we ended up with! Have a look at the renders!</p>

<p>I had even created animations of the car moving, check these links out:</p>
